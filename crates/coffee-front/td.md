### Order
This is where you place your order for coffee, I want to use a one-page order system, to avoid the laborious and overly verbose nature of wizards

### Counter
This is where orders are read, filled and responded to, it acts as a mini admin panel as counter operators are able to cancel orders

## Concepts
This is for fun, intended for non-commercial use. And follows a few main concepts

- no payment system
- no login or authentication
- publicly and freely accessible
- fun

This product obviously would not be safe to host publicly**
